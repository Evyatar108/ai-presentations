# Agents - Meeting Highlights COGS Reduction Presentation

## Recent Changes
### 2025-01-20: Final Slide - Thank You & Call to Action
**Ch9_S2_ClosingThanks Design:**
- **4 segments** with progressive reveal
  - Segment 0: "Thank You" title with animated gradient
  - Segment 1: "Reclaim time. Stay aligned." value statement
  - Segment 2: Feedback email card (meetinghlfeedback@microsoft.com)
  - Segment 3: Large CTA badge "Try Meeting Highlights - Available now in BizChat & SharePoint"
- **Rationale**: Professional closing that thanks audience, invites feedback, and provides clear call-to-action
- **Visual Design**: Animated particles, gradient text, pulsing CTA with shine effect
- **Updated files**:
  - [`Chapter9.tsx`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/chapters/Chapter9.tsx) - Ch9_S2_ClosingThanks component
  - [`SlidesRegistry.ts`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/SlidesRegistry.ts) - Updated reference
  - [`Agents.md`](Agents.md) - This entry


### 2025-01-20: Automatic Cleanup of Unused Audio Files
**Added Orphaned File Detection and Removal:**
- **Enhanced TTS Generation Script** ([`generate-tts.ts`](react_cogs_demo/scripts/generate-tts.ts))
  - Added `cleanupUnusedAudio()` function to scan for orphaned audio files
  - Detects WAV files in `public/audio/c*/` not referenced in any slide
  - Identifies orphaned cache entries for non-existent slides
  - Automatically deletes orphaned files and removes cache entries
  - Reports cleanup: "Cleaned up X files and Y cache entries"

- **Enhanced Cache Check Script** ([`check-tts-cache.ts`](react_cogs_demo/scripts/check-tts-cache.ts))
  - Added `detectOrphanedAudio()` function for pre-flight cleanup check
  - Prompts user before deletion: "Do you want to remove these unused files? (y/n)"
  - Shows list of orphaned files (up to 5, with "... and X more")
  - Cleans up both files and cache entries on confirmation
  - Runs before checking for narration changes

- **Updated Documentation**
  - [`README.md`](README.md) - Added cleanup workflow explanation
  - Section "TTS Cleanup Workflow" with 6-step process
  - Smart caching system now includes automatic cleanup feature

**Rationale:**
- Keeps audio directory synchronized with slide content
- Prevents accumulation of unused files from refactored/deleted slides
- Reduces storage usage and improves project organization
- Automatic detection prevents manual file management

**Technical Implementation:**
- Scans all chapter directories (`c0/` through `c9/`)
- Builds set of expected files from `SlidesRegistry.ts`
- Compares actual filesystem against expected files
- Normalizes paths (handles Windows backslashes)
- User confirmation required before deletion

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Documentation Maintenance

**When making changes to the project, ALWAYS update both:**
1. [`README.md`](README.md) - Main project documentation
2. [`Agents.md`](Agents.md) - This file (AI agent context & recent changes)

These files must stay synchronized with the codebase to provide accurate context for future work.

## Content Evolution

### 2025-01-20: Streamlined Presentation for All-Hands Audience
**Major Simplifications:**
- **Removed Chapter 3**: Architecture Overview slide (redundant with Ch2 team collaboration)
- **Streamlined Chapter 5**: Reduced from 6 slides to 1 slide
  - Kept only Ch5_S1_ChallengeFraming (shows the problem with metrics)
  - Removed detailed prompt explanation slides (Ch5_S3-S6)
  - Rationale: All-hands audience needs business impact, not implementation details
- **Streamlined Chapter 6**: Reduced from 5 slides to 2 slides
  - Kept Ch6_S1_UnifiedConvergence (4→1 call visualization)
  - Kept Ch6_S4_TokenOptimization (60% reduction)
  - Removed intermediate algorithm flow slides
- **Streamlined Chapter 7**: Reduced from 5 slides to 3 slides
  - Removed Ch7_S1_CallReduction (redundant with Ch6_S1)
  - Removed Ch7_S3_CostCurve (metrics covered in other slides)
  - Kept Ch7_S2_GPUReduction, Ch7_S4_QualityComparison, Ch7_S5_PathToGA
- **Result**: **15 total slides** (down from 23), clearer narrative flow, better pacing for all-hands presentation

### 2025-01-20: Chapter 2 Team Collaboration Slide Refactoring
**Fixed Narration-Visual Synchronization Issues:**
- **Problem**: Mismatch between narration audio and visual component reveals in Chapter 2 slide
- **Root cause**: Team array ordering didn't match segment indices, causing wrong cards to highlight
- **Fixed team array**: Reordered so Teams at index 5, Loop at index 6 (matching segment numbers)
- **Updated architecture diagram**: All ReactFlow nodes and edges now aligned with narration timing
- **Added MSAI duplicate**: Keeps MSAI-Hive card highlighted during ACS narration (segment 3)

**Code Consolidation:**
- **Inlined architecture diagram**: Moved ReactFlow component from separate [`Ch2_ArchitectureDiagram.tsx`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/Ch2_ArchitectureDiagram.tsx) into [`Chapter2.tsx`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/chapters/Chapter2.tsx)
- **Deleted separate file**: Removed redundant Ch2_ArchitectureDiagram.tsx (323 lines)
- **Added ReactFlow imports**: All dependencies now in single chapter file
- **Result**: Cleaner file structure, easier maintenance

**Audio File Path Corrections:**
- Fixed segment numbering to match actual generated files:
  - Teams: `s1_segment_06_teams.wav` (was 05)
  - Loop: `s1_segment_07_loop_storage.wav` (was 06)
  - Clipchamp: `s1_segment_08_clipchamp.wav` (was 07)
  - Conclusion: `s1_segment_09_conclusion.wav` (was 08)

**Teams Feature Clarification:**
- **Updated narration**: "We are also planning to provide access to highlights directly within the Teams ecosystem as another interface option"
- **Updated labels**: Changed from "Alternative UI" to "Planned UI" throughout
- **Reflects reality**: Teams access is planned, not yet implemented (BizChat is current primary UI)

**UI Enhancements:**
- **Sticky header**: "Backend Flow" header remains visible during scrolling
- **Auto-scroll**: Backend flow automatically scrolls to show newest items as they appear
- **Better layout**: Flexbox structure with fixed header and scrollable content area

**Final Segment Configuration (9 segments):**
- Segment 0: Intro
- Segment 1: ODSP
- Segment 2: MSAI-Hive
- Segment 3: ACS (keeps MSAI highlighted)
- Segment 4: BizChat
- Segment 5: Teams (with audio)
- Segment 6: Loop
- Segment 7: Clipchamp
- Segment 8: Conclusion

### 2025-01-20: Architecture Overview Slide Removal
**Removed Redundant Architecture Slide:**
- **Deleted**: [`Chapter3.tsx`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/chapters/Chapter3.tsx) (Architecture Overview slide)
- **Reason**: Slide was redundant and not needed for all-hands presentation focused on business impact
- **Updated**: [`SlidesRegistry.ts`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/SlidesRegistry.ts) to remove Ch3_S1_ArchitectureOverview import and reference
- **Result**: Presentation now has 22 slides (down from 23), streamlined flow from Team Collaboration directly to Highlight Types

### 2025-01-20: Chapter-Based File Organization
**Split AnimatedSlides.tsx into Chapter Files:**
- **Deleted**: Monolithic [`AnimatedSlides.tsx`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/AnimatedSlides.tsx) (3,075 lines)
- **Created**: 10 chapter files in [`src/slides/chapters/`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/chapters/) directory
- **File sizes**: Range from 33 lines (Chapter0) to 812 lines (Chapter7)
- **Average size**: ~296 lines per chapter file
- **Benefits**:
  - Improved navigation - find slides by opening relevant chapter
  - Reduced merge conflicts - developers work on separate chapters
  - Better IDE performance - smaller files load and parse faster
  - Logical organization - chapters align with presentation narrative
  - Scalable structure - easy to add new slides or split further
- **Updated**: [`SlidesRegistry.ts`](react_cogs_demo/src/slides/SlidesRegistry.ts) to import from chapter files
- **Verified**: TypeScript compilation passes, all 23 slides render correctly
- **Documentation**: Updated SPLITTING_STRATEGY.md with completion status

### 2025-01-20: Previous File Consolidation
**Earlier Consolidation Step (Now Superseded):**
- Initially merged all slides into single AnimatedSlides.tsx file
- Consolidated Ch2_TeamCollaboration, Ch7_S3_CostCurve, Ch7_S4_QualityComparison
- This monolithic file (3,075 lines) was then split into chapters (see above)

### 2025-01-20: Video Player Integration
**Added Demo Video Support:**
- Created VideoPlayer component ([`src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`](react_cogs_demo/src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx))

   - Manual+Audio mode was playing multiple audios simultaneously
   - Root cause: Async audio loading race condition
   - Solution: Implemented `isActive` flag to cancel stale audio loads
   - Comprehensive cleanup of all audio references and event listeners

4. **Audio Fallback System**
   - Created `silence-1s.mp3` fallback file
   - Graceful handling of missing audio files
   - Console warnings for debugging
   - No presentation crashes

5. **Updated All Audio File Paths**
   - Migrated from placeholder paths to actual TTS-generated files
   - Pattern: `/audio/c{chapter}/s{slide}_segment_{number}_{id}.wav`
   - ~65 audio file references updated across all slides

### 2025-01-19: Content Restructuring

### Content Restructuring
1. **Enhanced Introduction** - Expanded from 3 to 8 captions to comprehensively explain Meeting Highlights for all-hands audience
2. **Simplified COGS Challenge** - Removed detailed explanations of each of the 4 prompts, focusing on high-level impact
3. **Added Token Optimization Details** - Explicitly mentioned 60% input token reduction in both narration and slides
4. **Updated Business Impact** - Changed from "over 50%" to "over 70%" COGS reduction with "estimated" framing
5. **Enhanced React Slide** - Ch7_U1 now shows both call reduction dial AND token reduction bar chart side-by-side

### Code Changes
- Renamed all slide components from `_U` (Utterance) to `_S` (Slide) convention
- Removed 4 detailed prompt slides (Ch5_S3-S6 for individual prompts) from SlidesRegistry
- Deleted unused SlideRegistry.ts file
- Updated Ch7_S1_CallReduction to "Optimization Impact" with dual visualizations
- Implemented multi-segment slide support for progressive content reveal
- Organized slide definitions by chapter in `highlights_demo/chapters/cX/` folders

## Development

### Running the React Demo
```bash
cd react_cogs_demo
npm install
npm run dev
```
### TTS Audio Generation

**Start Python TTS Server:**
```bash
cd tts
python server.py --voice-sample path/to/voice.wav
```

**Generate Audio Files:**
```bash
cd react_cogs_demo

# Generate all files (uses smart cache to skip unchanged)
npm run tts:generate

# Force regenerate all files
npm run tts:generate -- --force

# Calculate durations
npm run tts:duration
```

**Development Workflow:**
1. Edit narration text in slide components
2. Run `npm run dev`
3. Pre-flight check detects changes
4. Answer "y" to regenerate automatically
5. Server starts with updated audio

**Cache Management:**
- Cache file: `react_cogs_demo/.tts-narration-cache.json`
- Duration report: `react_cogs_demo/duration-report.json`
- Audio files: `react_cogs_demo/public/audio/c{0-9}/`
```
