Let's take a closer look at how back-end systems orchestrate the process of generating meeting highlights.

6
00:00:39,641 --> 00:00:43,361
When a Teams meeting recording finishes, a back-end event is triggered.

7
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:46,681
This event initiates the highlight generation workflow.

8
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:54,801
The textual transcription of the meeting is sent directly to a large language model, which analyzes the content to identify key moments and topics.

9
00:00:55,121 --> 00:01:00,481
The model returns a structured list of textual metadata objects, with each representing a highlight.

10
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:10,321
Highlights fall into two categories: abstractive, which provide succinct summaries of discussion topics, and key moments, which pinpoint significant points in the original meeting.

11
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:20,081
Each highlight includes unique timestamps covering 20 to 30 second segments and a narration text that summarizes the key content.

12
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:29,441
This narration text is then converted into audio using Azure Cognitive Services speech APIs, creating a clear voiceover for each segment.

13
00:01:29,761 --> 00:01:34,801
For key moments, only the timestamp of the most interesting moment is selected by the model.

14
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:40,161
Captions and narrated audio for each highlight are generated and paired with these timestamps.

15
00:01:40,561 --> 00:01:42,801
all packaged as metadata objects.

16
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:52,721
Once generated, all highlight metadata, timestamps, narrated audio, and captions are securely stored in OneDrive SharePoint ODSP.

17
00:01:53,281 --> 00:02:01,521
This approach ensures that the highlights are readily available to various platforms like M365 Chat, Clipchamp Web, and the team's recap page.

18
00:02:01,841 --> 00:02:05,361
Importantly, the process does not create any new video files.

19
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:14,161
Only metadata is generated and stored, providing efficient access to key meeting moments across Microsoft 365 without additional storage overhead.
