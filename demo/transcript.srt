00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,641
Meeting Highlights transforms lengthy Teams meetings into dynamic, bite-sized video recaps, allowing users to quickly catch up on what matters most.

2
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:17,521
Combining AI-generated voiceover summaries with authentic video snippets, it captures important moments while preserving the original tone and flow.

3
00:00:18,802 --> 00:00:24,882
Thanks to this approach, users can review key topics and the overall meeting atmosphere without having to watch the entire recording.

4
00:00:26,642 --> 00:00:30,643
Developing meeting highlights was a complex collaboration across Microsoft.

5
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:33,283
ODSP handled back and streaming and storage.

6
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:38,963
MSAI Hive led content generation and scenario ownership, while Clipchamp and Loop enabled playback.

7
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,924
BizChat and Teams provide easy access for users.

8
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:47,604
Let's take a closer look at how backend systems orchestrate the process of generating meeting highlights.

9
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:51,284
When a Teams meeting recording finishes, a backend event is triggered.

10
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:54,005
This event initiates the highlight generation workflow.

11
00:00:54,245 --> 00:01:00,805
The textual transcription of the meeting is sent directly to a large language model, which analyzes the content to identify key moments and topics.

12
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:05,525
The model returns a structured list of textual metadata objects, with each representing a highlight.

13
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:13,606
Highlights fall into two categories: abstractive, which provides succinct summaries of discussion topics, and key moments, which pinpoint significant points in the original meeting.

14
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:20,567
Each highlight includes unique timestamps covering 20 to 30-second segments and a narration text that summarizes the key content.

15
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:25,127
This narration text is then converted into audio using Azure Cognitive Services.

16
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:32,088
Once generated, all highlight metadata, timestamps, narrated audio, and captions are securely stored in OneDrive SharePoint ODSP.

17
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:39,448
This approach ensures that the highlights are readily available to various platforms like M365 Chat, Clipchamp Web, and the team's recap page.

18
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:49,929
Importantly, the process does not create any new video files only metadata is generated and stored, providing efficient access to key meeting moments across Microsoft 365 without additional storage overhead.

19
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,570
Cost efficiency while maintaining quality is critical for scaling meeting highlights globally.

20
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,450
The initial implementation required 4 sequential LLM calls per meeting, creating significant computational costs.

21
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,851
The first prompt segmented transcripts into one to seven key topics.

22
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:12,171
The second prompt extracted up to ten self-contained utterance blocks, capturing key feedback, news, or demonstrations.

23
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:17,932
The third prompt ranked utterance blocks by quality, clarity, intelligibility, self-containment, and interest.

24
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:24,252
The fourth prompt synthesized a cohesive narrative with smooth transitions between abstractive and extractive sections.

25
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:28,893
We collapsed the four-step pipeline into one unified prompt with leaner input.

26
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:35,133
Dedicated tuning preserved the original algorithm as an internal reasoning chain: segment, extract, rank, compose.

27
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:40,093
The model executes this sequence in a single invocation instead of four external calls.

28
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,694
We trimmed input size significantly for lower cost.

29
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:49,374
Separate tuning adapted the model to the slimmer schema and token budget while maintaining valid output for video generation.

30
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:53,775
The impact: 75% fewer model invocations per meeting.

31
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:58,255
GPU requirements dropped from 600 to 200 for global availability.

32
00:02:59,375 --> 00:03:03,215
This cut COGS by over 50% enabling economically viable worldwide rollout.

33
00:03:04,656 --> 00:03:09,856
The unified prompt produces higher-quality highlights internal reviewers strongly prefer it over the multi-prompt version.

34
00:03:11,056 --> 00:03:15,216
These improvements unblock private preview and enable general availability within capacity constraints.

35
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:20,097
The Meeting Highlights feature has received overwhelmingly positive feedback in a recent Ms.

36
00:03:20,097 --> 00:03:24,097
Elite survey, underscoring its growing impact and daily use among our users.

37
00:03:25,297 --> 00:03:30,018
More than 80% of users rated Meeting Highlights as extremely useful or very useful.

38
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:37,538
In addition, 96% shared that they are very likely or likely to use the feature again, pointing to strong product-market fit and daily habit formation.

39
00:03:39,138 --> 00:03:41,219
Users have shared enthusiastic feedback.

40
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,539
Kevin C commented, Love this feature.

41
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:46,499
Great way to catch up on a recap without watching the full thing.

42
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:52,420
Ryan Roslonsky added, Beyond the awesome text recap, there is literally a two-minute narrated video about the meeting.

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,060
It's mind-blowing and an engaging way to recap a meeting for a richer understanding of the conversation.

44
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,220
While the core experience is resonating, users also expressed valuable requests for improvement.

45
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:11,461
Suggestions include making highlights more detailed and specific, integrating highlights more directly into Teams Recap, including action items, and supporting additional languages.
