# How Can Users Try Meeting Highlights

Open BizChat and ask it to recap a specific meeting. You can reference specific meetings using **CIQ (Contextual Instant Query)** - the ability to add a specific entity reference (file/meeting/email etc.) by typing `/` which opens a menu to select and search for entities to add to your message.

BizChat will return a reply to your query and a video player with the meeting highlights should appear at the bottom of the reply.

**Note:** If the meeting is a series meeting, BizChat currently won't show the meeting highlights player. We are working on additional ways to surface meeting highlights to our users, via BizChat and Teams.
