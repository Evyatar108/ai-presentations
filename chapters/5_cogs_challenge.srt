1
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:54,570
Cost efficiency while maintaining quality is critical for scaling meeting highlights globally.

2
00:01:55,930 --> 00:02:01,450
The initial implementation required 4 sequential LLM calls per meeting, creating significant computational costs.

3
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:05,851
The first prompt segmented transcripts into one to seven key topics.

4
00:02:06,931 --> 00:02:12,171
The second prompt extracted up to ten self-contained utterance blocks, capturing key feedback, news, or demonstrations.

5
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:17,932
The third prompt ranked utterance blocks by quality, clarity, intelligibility, self-containment, and interest.

6
00:02:19,052 --> 00:02:24,252
The fourth prompt synthesized a cohesive narrative with smooth transitions between abstractive and extractive sections.
