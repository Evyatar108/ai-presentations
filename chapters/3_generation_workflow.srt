Let's take a closer look at how backend systems orchestrate the process of generating meeting highlights.

2
00:00:48,164 --> 00:00:51,284
When a Teams meeting recording finishes, a backend event is triggered.

3
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:54,005
This event initiates the highlight generation workflow.

4
00:00:54,245 --> 00:01:00,805
The textual transcription of the meeting is sent directly to a large language model, which analyzes the content to identify key moments and topics.

5
00:01:00,965 --> 00:01:05,525
The model returns a structured list of textual metadata objects, with each representing a highlight.

00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:13,606
Highlights fall into two categories: abstractive, which provides succinct summaries of discussion topics, and key moments, which pinpoint significant points in the original meeting.
