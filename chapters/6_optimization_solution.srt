1
00:02:25,452 --> 00:02:28,893
We collapsed the four-step pipeline into one unified prompt with leaner input.

2
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:35,133
Dedicated tuning preserved the original algorithm as an internal reasoning chain: segment, extract, rank, compose.

3
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:40,093
The model executes this sequence in a single invocation instead of four external calls.

4
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,694
We trimmed input size significantly for lower cost.

5
00:02:44,174 --> 00:02:49,374
Separate tuning adapted the model to the slimmer schema and token budget while maintaining valid output for video generation.
