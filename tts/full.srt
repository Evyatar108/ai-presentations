00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,640
Meeting Highlights transforms lengthy Teams meetings into dynamic, bite-sized video recaps, allowing users to quickly catch up on what matters most.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:17,520
Combining AI-generated voiceover summaries with authentic video snippets, it captures important moments while preserving the original tone and flow.

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,880
Thanks to this approach, users can review key topics and the overall meeting atmosphere without having to watch the entire recording.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,560
Developing meeting highlights was a complex collaboration across Microsoft.

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,280
ODSP handled back and streaming and storage.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,960
MSAI Hive led content generation and scenario ownership, while Clipchamp and Loop enabled playback.

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,920
BizChat and Teams provide easy access for users.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,600
Let's take a closer look at how backend systems orchestrate the process of generating meeting highlights.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,280
When a Teams meeting recording finishes, a backend event is triggered.

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,000
This event initiates the highlight generation workflow.

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,800
The textual transcription of the meeting is sent directly to a large language model, which analyzes the content to identify key moments and topics.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,519
The model returns a structured list of textual metadata objects, with each representing a highlight.

13
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,680
Highlights fall into two categories: abstractive, which provides succinct summaries of discussion topics, and key moments, which pinpoint significant points in the original meeting.

14
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,560
Each highlight includes unique timestamps covering 20- to 30-second segments and a narration text that summarizes the key content.

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,120
This narration text is then converted into audio using Azure Cognitive Services.

16
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,080
Once generated, all highlight metadata, timestamps, narrated audio, and captions are securely stored in OneDrive SharePoint ODSP.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,440
This approach ensures that the highlights are readily available to various platforms like M365 Chat, Clipchamp Web, and the team's recap page.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:49,920
Importantly, the process does not create any new video files only metadata is generated and stored, providing efficient access to key meeting moments across Microsoft 365 without additional storage overhead.

19
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,560
Cost efficiency while maintaining quality is critical for scaling meeting highlights globally.

20
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,440
The initial implementation required 4 sequential LLM calls per meeting, creating significant computational costs.

21
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,920
The first prompt segmented transcripts into one to seven key topics.

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,160
The second prompt extracted up to 10 self-contained utterance blocks capturing key feedback, news, or demonstrations.

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,920
The third prompt ranked utterance blocks by quality, clarity, intelligibility, self-containment, and interest.

24
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,320
The 4th prompt synthesized A cohesive narrative with smooth transitions between abstractive and extractive sections.

25
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,880
We collapsed the four-step pipeline into one unified prompt with leaner input.

26
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,120
Dedicated tuning preserved the original algorithm as an internal reasoning chain: segment, extract, rank, compose.

27
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:40,079
The model executes this sequence in a single invocation instead of four external calls.

28
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,680
We trimmed input size significantly for lower cost.

29
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,360
Separate tuning adapted the model to the slimmer schema and token budget while maintaining valid output for video generation.

30
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,760
75% fewer model invocations per meeting.

31
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,240
GPU requirements dropped from 600 to 200 for global availability.

32
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,200
This cut COGS by over 50%, enabling economically viable worldwide rollout.

33
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,880
The unified prompt produces higher-quality highlights.

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,920
Internal reviewers strongly prefer it over the multi-prompt version.

35
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,200
These improvements unblock private preview and enable general availability within capacity constraints.

36
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,079
The meeting highlights feature has received overwhelmingly positive feedback in a recent Ms.

37
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:24,000
Elite survey, underscoring its growing impact and daily use among our users.

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,000
More than 80% of users rated meeting highlights as extremely useful or very useful.

39
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:37,520
In addition, 96% shared that they are very likely or likely to use the feature again, pointing to strong product market fit and daily habit formation.

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,280
Users have shared enthusiastic feedback.

41
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,600
Kevin C commented, Love this feature.

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,480
Great way to catch up on a recap without watching the full thing.

43
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,520
Ryan Roslonsky added, Beyond the awesome text recap.

44
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,400
There is literally a two-minute narrated video about the meeting.

45
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,040
It's mind-blowing and an engaging way to recap a meeting for a richer understanding of the conversation.

46
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:03,200
While the core experience is resonating, users also expressed valuable requests for improvement.

47
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,440
Suggestions include making highlights more detailed and specific, integrating highlights more directly into Teams Recap, including action items, and supporting additional languages.
