1
00:01:14,326 --> 00:01:20,567
Each highlight includes unique timestamps covering 20 to 30-second segments and a narration text that summarizes the key content.

2
00:01:20,807 --> 00:01:25,127
This narration text is then converted into audio using Azure Cognitive Services.

3
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:32,088
Once generated, all highlight metadata, timestamps, narrated audio, and captions are securely stored in OneDrive SharePoint ODSP.

4
00:01:32,488 --> 00:01:39,448
This approach ensures that the highlights are readily available to various platforms like M365 Chat, Clipchamp Web, and the team's recap page.

5
00:01:39,688 --> 00:01:49,929
Importantly, the process does not create any new video files only metadata is generated and stored, providing efficient access to key meeting moments across Microsoft 365 without additional storage overhead.
