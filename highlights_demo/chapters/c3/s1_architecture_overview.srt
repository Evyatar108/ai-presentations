00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Visual: High-level architecture diagram showing component flow
Let's look at the high-level architecture of how meeting highlights are generated.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Visual: Diagram highlights Teams Recording → ODSP path
When a Teams meeting recording finishes, a backend event is triggered in ODSP.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:18,000
Visual: Diagram highlights ODSP → TMR Processor path
ODSP initiates the highlight generation workflow by calling the TMR processor.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Visual: Diagram highlights TMR → LLM path with transcript
TMR sends the meeting transcript to a large language model for analysis.

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Visual: Diagram highlights LLM → TMR response with highlights metadata
The LLM returns structured metadata identifying key moments and topics.

6
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:39,000
Visual: Diagram highlights TMR → ACS for audio generation
TMR then calls Azure Cognitive Services to convert narration text into audio.

7
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,000
Visual: Diagram highlights final storage in ODSP and access via BizChat/Teams
Finally, all metadata, audio, and captions are stored in ODSP for access via BizChat and Teams.
